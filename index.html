    Outer space, commonly shortened to space, is the expanse that exists beyond
    Earth and its atmosphere and between celestial bodies. We, as humans, have
    always wondered what lies beyond the stars and this is a short tribute to
    human space exploration.

    On the 4 October, 1957, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (U.S.S.R.)
    launched the first artificial satellite, Sputnik 1, into space. The space
    race had begun between the between two Cold War adversaries, the Soviet
    Union and the United States, to achieve superior spaceflight capability. The
    first U.S. satellite, Explorer 1, went into orbit only a few months later,
    on the 31 January 1958. Four years later on 12 April 1961, Russian Lt. Yuri
    Gagarin became the first human to venture in space and orbit Earth in Vostok
    1.

    During the 1960s, NASA made progress toward President Kennedyâ€™s goal of
    landing a human on the moon with a program called Project Gemini, in which
    astronauts tested technology needed for future flights to the moon, and
    tested their own ability to endure many days in spaceflight. Project Gemini
    was followed by Project Apollo, which took astronauts into orbit around the
    moon and to the lunar surface between 1968 and 1972. In 1969, on

    Armstrong became the first human to set foot on its surface. During the
    landed missions, astronauts collected samples of rocks and lunar dust that
    scientists still study to learn about the moon.
